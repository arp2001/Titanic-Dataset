# Titanic-Dataset
EDA and Logistic Regression 
Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis and Logistic Regression on the Titanic Dataset
Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival and to develop a logistic regression model to predict survival outcomes. This will help in understanding the factors influencing survival and in building a predictive model based on these factors.

Dataset:
Source: The dataset is available on Kaggle and consists of information about passengers on the Titanic, including features such as age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived.
Key Features:
PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Ticket fare
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Tasks:
Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
Handle missing values (e.g., impute or remove).
Convert categorical variables into numerical formats using encoding techniques.
Normalize or scale numerical features if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Univariate Analysis:
Analyze the distribution of each feature (e.g., age, fare, etc.).
Plot histograms, box plots, and bar charts.
Bivariate Analysis:
Examine relationships between features and survival (e.g., survival rates by sex, age group, or ticket class).
Use visualizations like scatter plots, heatmaps, and group-by summaries.
Correlation Analysis:
Compute and visualize correlations between numerical features.
Use heatmaps to identify strong correlations and potential multicollinearity.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features or modify existing ones based on insights from EDA.
For instance, create age groups, extract titles from names, or encode embarkation ports.
Logistic Regression Model:

Model Building:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a logistic regression model on the training data.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Perform cross-validation to ensure the model’s robustness.
Feature Importance:
Analyze the coefficients of the logistic regression model to understand the impact of each feature on survival predictions.
Insights and Reporting:

Summarize key findings from the EDA.
Discuss the results of the logistic regression model and its implications.
Prepare a final report or presentation that includes visualizations, insights, and model performance metrics.
Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
IDE: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or any preferred Python IDE
Timeline:
Week 1: Data Preprocessing and Initial EDA
Week 2: In-depth EDA and Feature Engineering
Week 3: Model Building and Evaluation
Week 4: Insights and Reporting
Expected Outcomes:
A comprehensive analysis of factors influencing Titanic survival.
A logistic regression model capable of predicting survival outcomes with a reasonable level of accuracy.
Insights into feature importance and recommendations based on the analysis.
